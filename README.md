# jetson_configuration
Configuring the Jetson Nano for my deep learning tutorial

## Usage:

This bash script works only for jetpack 4.3, so make sure you use that version on your nano.
Dowload this repo and change permissions to jetson_configuration.sh file by typing "sudo chmod +x jetson_configuration.sh"
Run the script and give your user password, ./jetson_configuration.sh <youruserpassword>

##### This script will build all necessary wheel files and this takes time, so be prepared to wait several hours!
